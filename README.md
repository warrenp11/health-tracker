## Description
This group project was designed as a homework assignment for Rutgers Coding Boot Camp. 

We were challenged to build an interactive full-stack web application which used server-side JavaScript, RESTful APIs, databases, object-relational mapping, environment variables, templating, and authentication.

Our Health Tracker allows the user to keep track of their daily workouts using a simple web application. You must first create an account, then you are able to access the dashboard which allows you to add a workout. Next time just log in and you can add your next workout below your previous one!
